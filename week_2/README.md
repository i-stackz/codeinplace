Pending challenges:

Midpoint Karel --> Currently, having difficulties with this one because I cannot set a variable in Karel. It would be easier to solve if I can set a counter to count her steps until "front_is_blocked()". I would divide that variable by 2 and have karel backtrack by that value. Either way I will post what I have..

Checkerboard Karel --> I am also having difficulties with this challenge due to having to factor in the layout of different levels. Either way I will post what I have.
